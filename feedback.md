# Project 2 Evaluation

## Technical Requirements

**2: Performing**

>The app contains 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD.

Nice job executing the many to many relationship!

## Creativity and Interface

**2 : Performing**

> The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

Loved the them, and hope to see you continue to evolve the UI.

## Code Quality

**2 : Performing**

> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

Please review my [inline code comments](https://github.com/alman92/Fireside2/compare/master...nolds9:feedback) prefixed with my initials (`NHO:`)

## Functionality

**2 : Performing**

> Application contains no major errors

Overall some minor routing issues, but definitely works  to solve the problem you set out to answer!

## Planning / Process / Submission

**0: Incomplete**

> No submission received, or submission does not contain basic documentation of planning (ERD, wireframes, commit history, etc)

Missing evidence of planning with submission.
